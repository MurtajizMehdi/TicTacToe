# TicTacToe
This program, or it's code rather, allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe.
There are a few issues within the code that I am still working on.
For some of the options, it directly displays the menu screen again,
but for others, it'll ask the user if they want to return to the menu.
I plan on implementing the function that asks the user if they want
to return to the main screen at the end the option functions.
I also want to stray away from number-choice, and instead want to use either
A-D or be able to go off of whatever the user inputs.
If there are any more recommendations, please do not hesitate to reach out!
