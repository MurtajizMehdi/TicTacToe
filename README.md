# TicTacToe
This program, or it's code rather, allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe.
There a few issues within the code that I am still working on.
For some of the options, it directly displays the menu screen again,
but for others, it'll ask the user if they want to return to the menu.
I plan on implementing the function that asks the user if they want
to return to the main screen at the end the option functions.
If there are any more recommendations, please do not hesitate to reach out!
